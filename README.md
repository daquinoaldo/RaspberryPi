# RaspberryPi
### Raspberry Pi scripts and tips for dummies (like me)

I created this repository mainly for myself, so I do not have to search the right script or command every time. So I decided to keep a toolbox with the useful tools to keep close at hand.
I have made it public so that all those who need it can benefit from it.

### Disclaimer
Every script, command or suggestion must be taken "as is", without any guarantee. Some commands may not be updated or compatible with the version of Raspbian you are using.

### Contribute
You can contribute to this collection by opening iussue (which if and when I will have time I will watch) and doing pull requests.
In particular, if any script here has been useful for you, you are invited to contribute by releasing something, even in the form of links to your repository, site or tutorial.
